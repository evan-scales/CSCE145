/*Solution Description
 * In this program we find the average number of all positive doubles in an array. First thing to do is
 *  to find the sum of all the positive doubles. A variable called sum is declared and set at 0.0. That
 *  is because the sum could be nothing at all if all the numbers are negative, and you donâ€™t want the sum
 *  to be null. Count is another variable declared, which will later be used to divide the sum. Usually to
 *  find the average you would divide by the arrays length but if a number is negative that would give the wrong
 *  output. A for loop is used to go through every index in the array. If the number at the index is greater than
 *  0 then that number is added to the sum variable and count goes up by 1. After that if sum is greater than 0 then
 *  sum is divided by the count to find the average. Sum could be 0 if all the numbers in the array are negative, which
 *  is why sum is checked if its above 0. After all that then the average is printed to the console.
